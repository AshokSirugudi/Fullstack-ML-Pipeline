# Fullstack ML Pipeline

An end-to-end repository for machine learning workflows, covering the full lifecycle from raw data to deployment readiness.

---

## 📌 Project Orientation

**What**: End-to-end ML workflows with full lifecycle — from data to deployment readiness. 
**Why**: Demonstrates proficiency in engineering, modeling, and ML system design. 
**Where**: Focuses on real projects with clean pipelines, reproducibility, and evaluation. 
**Which**: Best for structured classification and regression problems. 
**How**: Clean data → engineer features → train & evaluate models → automate pipelines.
